# alterke
The unnamed project

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name):
> In Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as "Alter" (Yiddish: אלטער‎, literally "old"), or Alterke, the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it.
